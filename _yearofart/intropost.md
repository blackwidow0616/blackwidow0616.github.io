# My Theme for 2023 is a Year of Art.

You may be asking yourself, "What is a theme?"  
Well here is a brief youtube video to introduce the concept:

This video is how I was introduced to this concept a few years ago. Since then 
I've done a theme for each year. In 2021, I did a Year of Health. In 2022, I did a 
Year of Discipline.   

## So that brings me to my 2023 theme of a Year of Art.  
Now why did I choose this to be my theme:   
Well I have a full-time job and a cat, and yet I have been feeling dissatisfied 
with my limited personal time and what I do with it. So, as I stare at my 
collection of blank canvases and drawers full of unfinished and unstarted creative 
work, I have decided that by choosing my 2023 theme to be a Year of Art, I can 
work to become more fulfilled in my personal time while also _finishing_ all the 
artistic projects I have began and get better at doing the art I want to do.   

> You'll never get better if you never do.
